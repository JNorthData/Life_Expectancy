Analysis Report: Life Expectancy Factors


In the 21st Century, human life expectancy around the world DOUBLED – from about 31 years in 1900 to about 62 years in 2000. Our study uses data spanning the 81 years between 1960 and 2021, and encompasses over 200 countries. Our data sources include the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and the website Our World in Data. 

World Life Expectancy rose steadily over the past 80 years, hitting a peak average of around 73 in 2019. Until then, LE had increase by an average of 4 months each year. From 2019 to 2021 however, global LE actually decreased by about 2 years due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. 

Throughout this time, one striking statistic has remained constant: Women outlive men. As of 2021, women live, on average, about 6 years longer than men. This fact is true not only over time, but also across all countries around the entire world.

Within a given population, women tend to outlive men. However, when we separate populations into rich vs. poor, another constant emerges: the Wealthy outlive the Poor. While women outlive men within their own populations, women living in poor countries (as measured by GDP) don’t live as long as men living in wealthy countries. On average, a 1st world man will live about 10 years longer than a 3rd world woman. And a 1st world woman can expect to live about 20 years longer than a 3rd world man. 

Broadly speaking, inhabitants of wealthy nations enjoy a longer LE than those of poor nations. As GDP rises, so does LE. With increased longevity of it’s citizens, a nations population gradually increases. There is evidence in our data that as GDP and population increase, eventually a tipping point is reached where the needs of the population outpace the economic output of the economy, and the population experiences diminished returns on it’s economic output. 

In 1960, increases in the populations of the world showed some correlation with increased life expectancy. This trend continued until 1978, when the relationship between LE and rising populations flatlined, and then by 1980, a downward correlation between LE and populations set in, a trend which has continued until now. As populations continue to increase, LE is actually now decreasing.
